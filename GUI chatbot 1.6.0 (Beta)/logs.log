 ChatGPT web browsing ideas 
 
 
 
 Now that OpenAI have made public a new array of plugins and features – here’s  how to use ChatGPT’s web browsing plugin , which changes everything. 
 The update quietly rolled out on May 15th, and since then users have quietly been discovering the new beta features on the  ChatGPT Plus  platform.  
 Note:  At the time of writing, the ChatGPT web browsing plugin is temporarily disabled whilst OpenAI fix an issue to ensure content creators privacy. 
 While the news that  ChatGPT plugins  would have  access to the internet  isn’t particularly new – they were particularly limited in scope. However, the standalone web browsing beta plugin is going to open up new possibilities of AI use – both good and bad. 
 
 
 
 
 ChatGPT web browsing: Here’s how to use it 
 There’s a few major things that you’re going to need to do here. We’ve detailed them in a list below: 
 
 Sign up for  ChatGPT Plus  (Note: Not all Plus users have access yet) 
 Open menu (Three dots icon in bottom left of screen) 
 Click  Settings 
 Click  Beta features 
 Enable  Web browsing 
 Start New Chat in ChatGPT 
 Choose  GPT-4  at the top of the screen 
 Click drop-down menu to the right and enable  Browsing (Beta) 
 
 Once you’ve started a new chat, you’re going to be able to paste links into ChatGPT, though there are also other ways to browse the internet with ChatGPT. 
 What can you do with ChatGPT web browsing? 
 Here’s a few of the things you can do with ChatGPT web browsing: 
 
 We asked ChatGPT to summarize this web-page and repeat to us the key information. However, there were a few minor issues. We noticed that ChatGPT makes some assumptions here to fill in the gaps. The original page mentions ‘steerability’ and how it has improved, though there isn’t a claim that this concept was introduced in GPT-4. 
 Once ChatGPT receives a link to read through – it opens this drop-down menu where you can watch the chatbots activities and journey through the site. There are quite a few re-occurring “Click failed” error messages, and we have yet to figure out the cause of this issue. 
 
 Alternatively, you can also ask ChatGPT to browse the internet for you, without directly inputting a link. This feature is going to be monumental, and with recent changes to Google, especially integrating an  AI generative experience into Search , the implementation of ChatGPT web browsing will keep reasserting OpenAI as competitive with other AI companies. 
 
 This only scratches the surface of what ChatGPT web browsing can achieve, and we’re sure to see a flurry of new methods, tricks, hacks, and alike announce themselves. 
 ChatGPT web browsing ideas 
 If you’re anyone with a digitally-inclined mind – ChatGPT web browsing should sound enticing to you. Here’s a few things that you can try to get the most out of AI in the modern day: 
 
 Summarise long articles 
 Research and ideas for online blog content 
 Networking 
 Education 
 Content ideation 
 
 These are only but a few of the things that ChatGPT’s internet access is going to make possible – so we’re going to be keeping our eyes out for the latest updates on everything ChatGPT web browsing related. In the meantime, you might be interested in how  GPT-4 image input  and  Google Bard image input  are doing.

 BANGKOK: Thai members of parliament (MPs) and senators will convene on Thursday (Jul 13) to vote on the next prime minister, almost two months after the country’s general election. 
 The joint sitting will determine whether prime minister hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, can win the premiership race and become the 30th prime minister of Thailand. 
 His party Move Forward pulled off a surprise electoral victory on May 14 and  formed a coalition with seven allies . Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives – the lower house of parliament. 
 Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate – the Upper House. 
 This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. 
 The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. 
 “We’ve come too far to lose,” Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party’s thank-you rally in Bangkok.  
 “Just a bit more. We’ll reach the finish line together.” 
 Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. 
 The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita’s name when he ran in the election on May 14. 
 According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. 
 Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family’s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. 
 ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  
 Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute.

 If Mr Pita’s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. 
 On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission’s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. 
 “In this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,” he said in a press conference. 
 “This could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,” he added. 
 HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED 
 The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.  
 Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs – or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House’ total members.

 According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. 
 The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. 
 Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.  
 In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses – 375 – can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an “outsider prime minister’”. 
 WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND 
 Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader’s premiership is still up in the air. 
 Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. 
 All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha – Thailand’s caretaker prime minister – after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. 
 His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. 
 After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.  
 The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military’s presence in politics as well as the senators’ role in the prime ministerial selection.

 Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. 
 “In normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,” Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. 
 “We still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people’s consensus.”

 Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. 
 One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.  
 The announcement came after General Prayut – the party’s prime ministerial candidate –  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.  
 The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party’s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. 
 The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. 
 Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.  
 Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years – the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. 
 Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. 
 “GIVE THAILAND A CHANCE” 
 The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand’s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. 
 There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. 
 Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. 
 With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. 
 On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has “abnormal politics” created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. 
 “Give Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people’s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,” he said in a video clip shared on his social media.  
 “The vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,” he added.

 BANGKOK: Thai members of parliament (MPs) and senators will convene on Thursday (Jul 13) to vote on the next prime minister, almost two months after the country’s general election. 
 The joint sitting will determine whether prime minister hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, can win the premiership race and become the 30th prime minister of Thailand. 
 His party Move Forward pulled off a surprise electoral victory on May 14 and  formed a coalition with seven allies . Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives – the lower house of parliament. 
 Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate – the Upper House. 
 This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. 
 The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. 
 “We’ve come too far to lose,” Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party’s thank-you rally in Bangkok.  
 “Just a bit more. We’ll reach the finish line together.” 
 Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. 
 The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita’s name when he ran in the election on May 14. 
 According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. 
 Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family’s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. 
 ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  
 Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute.

 If Mr Pita’s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. 
 On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission’s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. 
 “In this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,” he said in a press conference. 
 “This could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,” he added. 
 HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED 
 The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.  
 Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs – or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House’ total members.

 According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. 
 The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. 
 Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.  
 In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses – 375 – can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an “outsider prime minister’”. 
 WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND 
 Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader’s premiership is still up in the air. 
 Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. 
 All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha – Thailand’s caretaker prime minister – after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. 
 His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. 
 After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.  
 The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military’s presence in politics as well as the senators’ role in the prime ministerial selection.

 Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. 
 “In normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,” Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. 
 “We still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people’s consensus.”

 Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. 
 One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.  
 The announcement came after General Prayut – the party’s prime ministerial candidate –  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.  
 The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party’s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. 
 The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. 
 Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.  
 Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years – the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. 
 Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. 
 “GIVE THAILAND A CHANCE” 
 The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand’s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. 
 There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. 
 Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. 
 With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. 
 On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has “abnormal politics” created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. 
 “Give Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people’s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,” he said in a video clip shared on his social media.  
 “The vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,” he added.

 BANGKOK: Thai members of parliament (MPs) and senators will convene on Thursday (Jul 13) to vote on the next prime minister, almost two months after the country’s general election. 
 The joint sitting will determine whether prime minister hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, can win the premiership race and become the 30th prime minister of Thailand. 
 His party Move Forward pulled off a surprise electoral victory on May 14 and  formed a coalition with seven allies . Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives – the lower house of parliament. 
 Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate – the Upper House. 
 This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. 
 The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. 
 “We’ve come too far to lose,” Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party’s thank-you rally in Bangkok.  
 “Just a bit more. We’ll reach the finish line together.” 
 Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. 
 The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita’s name when he ran in the election on May 14. 
 According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. 
 Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family’s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. 
 ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  
 Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute.

 If Mr Pita’s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. 
 On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission’s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. 
 “In this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,” he said in a press conference. 
 “This could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,” he added. 
 HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED 
 The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.  
 Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs – or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House’ total members.

 According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. 
 The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. 
 Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.  
 In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses – 375 – can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an “outsider prime minister’”. 
 WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND 
 Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader’s premiership is still up in the air. 
 Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. 
 All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha – Thailand’s caretaker prime minister – after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. 
 His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. 
 After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.  
 The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military’s presence in politics as well as the senators’ role in the prime ministerial selection.

 Military-appointed Senate poses potential hindrance for Thai PM candidate Pita Limjaroenrat 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. 
 “In normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,” Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. 
 “We still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people’s consensus.”

 Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. 
 One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.  
 The announcement came after General Prayut – the party’s prime ministerial candidate –  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.  
 The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party’s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. 
 The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. 
 Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.  
 Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years – the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. 
 Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. 
 “GIVE THAILAND A CHANCE” 
 The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand’s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. 
 There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. 
 Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. 
 With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. 
 On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has “abnormal politics” created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. 
 “Give Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people’s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,” he said in a video clip shared on his social media.  
 “The vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,” he added.

Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives \\u2013 the lower house of parliament. \\n Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate \\u2013 the Upper House. \\n This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. \\n The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. \\n \\u201cWe\\u2019ve come too far to lose,\\u201d Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party\\u2019s thank-you rally in Bangkok.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cJust a bit more. We\\u2019ll reach the finish line together.\\u201d \\n Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. \\n The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita\\u2019s name when he ran in the election on May 14. \\n According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. \\n Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family\\u2019s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. \\n ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  \\n Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thai Election Commission recommends suspension of PM frontrunner Pita \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Move Forward Party claims discrepancies detected in Thai PM-elect\'s media share controversy \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n If Mr Pita\\u2019s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. \\n On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission\\u2019s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. \\n \\u201cIn this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,\\u201d he said in a press conference. \\n \\u201cThis could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,\\u201d he added. \\n HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED \\n The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.\\u00a0 \\n Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs \\u2013 or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House\\u2019 total members. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      A view of Thailand\'s parliament in Bangkok, on Oct 26, 2020. (Photo: Reuters/Chalinee Thirasupa)\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. \\n The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. \\n Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.\\u00a0 \\n In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses \\u2013 375 \\u2013 can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an \\u201coutsider prime minister\\u2019\\u201d. \\n WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND \\n Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader\\u2019s premiership is still up in the air. \\n Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. \\n All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha \\u2013 Thailand\\u2019s caretaker prime minister \\u2013 after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. \\n His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. \\n After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.\\u00a0 \\n The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military\\u2019s presence in politics as well as the senators\\u2019 role in the prime ministerial selection. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n New Thai House Speaker could pave way for Move Forward\\u2019s Pita Limjaroenrat to become prime minister, but challenges remain: Analysts \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Military-appointed Senate poses potential hindrance for Thai PM candidate Pita Limjaroenrat \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. \\n \\u201cIn normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,\\u201d Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. \\n \\u201cWe still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people\\u2019s consensus.\\u201d \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Pita Limjaroenrat greeted supporters during the Move Forward Party\'s thank-you rally in Bangkok on Jul 9, 2023. (Photo: Move Forward Party)\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. \\n One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.\\u00a0 \\n The announcement came after General Prayut \\u2013 the party\\u2019s prime ministerial candidate \\u2013  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.\\u00a0 \\n The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party\\u2019s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. \\n The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. \\n Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.\\u00a0 \\n Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years \\u2013 the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. \\n Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. \\n \\u201cGIVE THAILAND A CHANCE\\u201d \\n The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand\\u2019s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. \\n There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. \\n Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. \\n With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. \\n On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has \\u201cabnormal politics\\u201d created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. \\n \\u201cGive Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people\\u2019s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,\\u201d he said in a video clip shared on his social media.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cThe vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,\\u201d he added. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Commentary: Inequality fuelling the fire for Thailand\\u2019s political change \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thailand\'s monarchy looms over battle for prime minister post: Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    Source: CNA/pp(as)\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Related Topics\\n   \\n \\n      Thailand\\n   \\n \\n      Thailand election\\n   \\n \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Also worth reading\\n   \\n \\n Content is loading... \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Expand to read the full story\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      CNA Sections\\n   \\n \\n \\n Asia \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Singapore \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Business \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CNA Insider \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Lifestyle \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Luxury \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CNA938 Live \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Commentary \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Interactives \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Live TV \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Sport \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n World \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Special Reports \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      About CNA\\n   \\n \\n \\n About Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Advertise With Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Contact Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Hotel Partners \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Correspondents \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Presenters \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mediacorp Network \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Pressed for time?

 BANGKOK: Thai members of parliament (MPs) and senators will convene on Thursday (Jul 13) to vote on the next prime minister, almost two months after the country’s general election. 
 The joint sitting will determine whether prime minister hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, can win the premiership race and become the 30th prime minister of Thailand. 
 His party Move Forward pulled off a surprise electoral victory on May 14 and  formed a coalition with seven allies . Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives – the lower house of parliament. 
 Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate – the Upper House. 
 This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. 
 The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. 
 “We’ve come too far to lose,” Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party’s thank-you rally in Bangkok.  
 “Just a bit more. We’ll reach the finish line together.” 
 Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. 
 The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita’s name when he ran in the election on May 14. 
 According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. 
 Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family’s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. 
 ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  
 Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute.

 If Mr Pita’s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. 
 On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission’s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. 
 “In this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,” he said in a press conference. 
 “This could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,” he added. 
 HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED 
 The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.  
 Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs – or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House’ total members.

 According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. 
 The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. 
 Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.  
 In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses – 375 – can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an “outsider prime minister’”. 
 WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND 
 Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader’s premiership is still up in the air. 
 Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. 
 All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha – Thailand’s caretaker prime minister – after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. 
 His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. 
 After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.  
 The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military’s presence in politics as well as the senators’ role in the prime ministerial selection.

 Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. 
 “In normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,” Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. 
 “We still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people’s consensus.”

 Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. 
 One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.  
 The announcement came after General Prayut – the party’s prime ministerial candidate –  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.  
 The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party’s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. 
 The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. 
 Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.  
 Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years – the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. 
 Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. 
 “GIVE THAILAND A CHANCE” 
 The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand’s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. 
 There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. 
 Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. 
 With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. 
 On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has “abnormal politics” created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. 
 “Give Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people’s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,” he said in a video clip shared on his social media.  
 “The vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,” he added.

Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives \\u2013 the lower house of parliament. \\n Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate \\u2013 the Upper House. \\n This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. \\n The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. \\n \\u201cWe\\u2019ve come too far to lose,\\u201d Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party\\u2019s thank-you rally in Bangkok.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cJust a bit more. We\\u2019ll reach the finish line together.\\u201d \\n Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. \\n The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita\\u2019s name when he ran in the election on May 14. \\n According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. \\n Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family\\u2019s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. \\n ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  \\n Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thai Election Commission recommends suspension of PM frontrunner Pita \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Move Forward Party claims discrepancies detected in Thai PM-elect\'s media share controversy \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n If Mr Pita\\u2019s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. \\n On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission\\u2019s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. \\n \\u201cIn this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,\\u201d he said in a press conference. \\n \\u201cThis could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,\\u201d he added. \\n HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED \\n The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.\\u00a0 \\n Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs \\u2013 or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House\\u2019 total members. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      A view of Thailand\'s parliament in Bangkok, on Oct 26, 2020. (Photo: Reuters/Chalinee Thirasupa)\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. \\n The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. \\n Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.\\u00a0 \\n In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses \\u2013 375 \\u2013 can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an \\u201coutsider prime minister\\u2019\\u201d. \\n WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND \\n Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader\\u2019s premiership is still up in the air. \\n Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. \\n All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha \\u2013 Thailand\\u2019s caretaker prime minister \\u2013 after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. \\n His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. \\n After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.\\u00a0 \\n The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military\\u2019s presence in politics as well as the senators\\u2019 role in the prime ministerial selection. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n New Thai House Speaker could pave way for Move Forward\\u2019s Pita Limjaroenrat to become prime minister, but challenges remain: Analysts \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Military-appointed Senate poses potential hindrance for Thai PM candidate Pita Limjaroenrat \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. \\n \\u201cIn normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,\\u201d Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. \\n \\u201cWe still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people\\u2019s consensus.\\u201d \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Pita Limjaroenrat greeted supporters during the Move Forward Party\'s thank-you rally in Bangkok on Jul 9, 2023. (Photo: Move Forward Party)\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. \\n One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.\\u00a0 \\n The announcement came after General Prayut \\u2013 the party\\u2019s prime ministerial candidate \\u2013  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.\\u00a0 \\n The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party\\u2019s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. \\n The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. \\n Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.\\u00a0 \\n Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years \\u2013 the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. \\n Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. \\n \\u201cGIVE THAILAND A CHANCE\\u201d \\n The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand\\u2019s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. \\n There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. \\n Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. \\n With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. \\n On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has \\u201cabnormal politics\\u201d created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. \\n \\u201cGive Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people\\u2019s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,\\u201d he said in a video clip shared on his social media.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cThe vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,\\u201d he added. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Commentary: Inequality fuelling the fire for Thailand\\u2019s political change \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thailand\'s monarchy looms over battle for prime minister post: Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    Source: CNA/pp(as)\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Related Topics\\n   \\n \\n      Thailand\\n   \\n \\n      Thailand election\\n   \\n \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Also worth reading\\n   \\n \\n Content is loading... \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Expand to read the full story\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      CNA Sections\\n   \\n \\n \\n Asia \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Singapore \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Business \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CNA Insider \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Lifestyle \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Luxury \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CNA938 Live \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Commentary \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Interactives \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Live TV \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Sport \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n World \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Special Reports \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      About CNA\\n   \\n \\n \\n About Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Advertise With Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Contact Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Hotel Partners \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Correspondents \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Presenters \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mediacorp Network \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Pressed for time?

 BANGKOK: Thai members of parliament (MPs) and senators will convene on Thursday (Jul 13) to vote on the next prime minister, almost two months after the country’s general election. 
 The joint sitting will determine whether prime minister hopeful Pita Limjaroenrat, 42, can win the premiership race and become the 30th prime minister of Thailand. 
 His party Move Forward pulled off a surprise electoral victory on May 14 and  formed a coalition with seven allies . Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives – the lower house of parliament. 
 Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate – the Upper House. 
 This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. 
 The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. 
 “We’ve come too far to lose,” Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party’s thank-you rally in Bangkok.  
 “Just a bit more. We’ll reach the finish line together.” 
 Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. 
 The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita’s name when he ran in the election on May 14. 
 According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. 
 Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family’s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. 
 ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  
 Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute.

 If Mr Pita’s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. 
 On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission’s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. 
 “In this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,” he said in a press conference. 
 “This could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,” he added. 
 HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED 
 The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.  
 Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs – or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House’ total members.

 According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. 
 The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. 
 Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.  
 In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses – 375 – can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an “outsider prime minister’”. 
 WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND 
 Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader’s premiership is still up in the air. 
 Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. 
 All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha – Thailand’s caretaker prime minister – after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. 
 His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. 
 After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.  
 The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military’s presence in politics as well as the senators’ role in the prime ministerial selection.

 Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. 
 “In normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,” Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. 
 “We still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people’s consensus.”

 Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. 
 One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.  
 The announcement came after General Prayut – the party’s prime ministerial candidate –  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.  
 The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party’s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. 
 The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. 
 Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.  
 Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years – the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. 
 Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. 
 “GIVE THAILAND A CHANCE” 
 The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand’s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. 
 There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. 
 Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. 
 With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. 
 On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has “abnormal politics” created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. 
 “Give Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people’s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,” he said in a video clip shared on his social media.  
 “The vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,” he added.

Together, they have 312 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives \\u2013 the lower house of parliament. \\n Still, for Mr Pita to become prime minister, he needs the approval from more than half of the combined assembly, which includes the 250-member Senate \\u2013 the Upper House. \\n This means he must garner at least 376 votes from both Houses or the Lower House alone in order to win the premiership and form the government. \\n The selection of the prime minister is likely to be closely watched by the people of Thailand, as it will show whether their electoral consensus is respected by the parliamentarians. \\n \\u201cWe\\u2019ve come too far to lose,\\u201d Mr Pita addressed his supporters on Jul 9 during his party\\u2019s thank-you rally in Bangkok.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cJust a bit more. We\\u2019ll reach the finish line together.\\u201d \\n Mr Pita faces possible disqualification of his MP membership after the Election Commission asked the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to rule whether it should be terminated. \\n The termination is related to 42,000 shares of media firm ITV, which were held under Mr Pita\\u2019s name when he ran in the election on May 14. \\n According to the Thai constitution, individuals are prohibited from running in an election of Members of the House of Representatives if they are shareholders of any newspaper or mass media business. \\n Mr Pita claimed he managed the shares on behalf of his family\\u2019s inheritance fund. He later transferred them to other heirs. \\n ITV officially began broadcasting in 1996. It lost the right to use the frequency for broadcasting in 2007 after the Office of the Prime Minister revoked its concession agreement.  \\n Currently, the company and the Office of the Prime Minister are involved in an ongoing legal dispute. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thai Election Commission recommends suspension of PM frontrunner Pita \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Move Forward Party claims discrepancies detected in Thai PM-elect\'s media share controversy \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n If Mr Pita\\u2019s MP membership is disqualified, he can still be nominated for the prime ministerial position on Thursday as the constitution does not require the prime minister to be an MP. \\n On Wednesday, Move Forward Party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon remonstrated against the Election Commission\\u2019s action, questioning why the electoral watchdog did not inform Mr Pita of the allegation or allow him a chance to clarify the matter. \\n \\u201cIn this case, the Move Forward Party views that the Election Commission selectively followed certain regulations and intended not to comply with the regulations it installed completely or rightfully,\\u201d he said in a press conference. \\n \\u201cThis could amount to an offence of dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise duties, according to Section 157 of the Criminal Code,\\u201d he added. \\n HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED \\n The parliamentary session to select the prime minister is scheduled to begin at 9.30am local time.\\u00a0 \\n Parties with at least 25 elected MPs can nominate a prime minister, and the nomination must be endorsed by at least 50 elected MPs \\u2013 or no less than one-tenth of the Lower House\\u2019 total members. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      A view of Thailand\'s parliament in Bangkok, on Oct 26, 2020. (Photo: Reuters/Chalinee Thirasupa)\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, MPs and senators will have an opportunity to debate before casting their votes. The debate is expected to take about six hours. \\n The vote to select the prime minister will then take place in a joint sitting, where each MP and senator is called out by name. They cast their votes by saying the name of the candidate they support. \\n Whoever receives more than 375 votes will become the prime minister. In the event that nobody receives the requisite number of votes, both Houses will need to revote.\\u00a0 \\n In case none of the listed candidates can be appointed for any reason, at least half of the members of both Houses \\u2013 375 \\u2013 can request the National Assembly to start a process that could allow an \\u201coutsider prime minister\\u2019\\u201d. \\n WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND \\n Although Move Forward swept to victory in the May 14 election, its leader\\u2019s premiership is still up in the air. \\n Mr Pita needs 64 more votes to secure the position on Thursday, but it is unclear whether he has such support, especially from the senators. \\n All 250 of them rose to power unelected. They were handpicked by the military government of Prayut Chan-o-cha \\u2013 Thailand\\u2019s caretaker prime minister \\u2013 after he led a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. \\n His junta ruled Thailand for nearly five years before allowing an election to take place in 2019, under a new constitution written by a military-appointed committee. It gives power to the Senate to jointly select the prime minister with the House of Representatives until May 2024. \\n After the previous election in 2019, when General Prayut contested the premiership, all but one senator voted for him.\\u00a0 \\n The scenario is different this time with Mr Pita, whose party has been critical of the military\\u2019s presence in politics as well as the senators\\u2019 role in the prime ministerial selection. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n New Thai House Speaker could pave way for Move Forward\\u2019s Pita Limjaroenrat to become prime minister, but challenges remain: Analysts \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Military-appointed Senate poses potential hindrance for Thai PM candidate Pita Limjaroenrat \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Ahead of the Thursday vote, several senators seemed undecided on whether they would support the Move Forward Party leader. Some expressed their support while others made it clear they would not vote for him. \\n \\u201cIn normal politics, the coalition government led by the Move Forward Party should have already begun running the country and solving the problems of the people. But now, nearly two months after the election, the vote on the prime minister has just come along,\\u201d Mr Pita said on social media on Tuesday. \\n \\u201cWe still have to wait for the senators to decide whether the forming of the government will be in accordance with the people\\u2019s consensus.\\u201d \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Pita Limjaroenrat greeted supporters during the Move Forward Party\'s thank-you rally in Bangkok on Jul 9, 2023. (Photo: Move Forward Party)\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Meanwhile, it is clear that the prime minister hopeful will not receive the approval of at least 132 MPs from three parties. \\n One of them is the United Thai Nation Party, which won 36 seats in the May election. It said on Tuesday its MPs had agreed not to vote for Mr Pita to become the next prime minister.\\u00a0 \\n The announcement came after General Prayut \\u2013 the party\\u2019s prime ministerial candidate \\u2013  said he would retire from politics  after being in power for nine years.\\u00a0 \\n The other party is Bhumjaithai. It issued a statement in May, maintaining it will not support a prime minister candidate whose party\\u2019s policies include the amendment or abolishment of the royal defamation law. \\n The same reason was used by the Democrat Party, which announced on Jul 12 its 25 MPs will abstain from the vote on Thursday. \\n Mr Pita and his party support the amendment of the law to prevent it from being used as a political tool.\\u00a0 \\n Also known as the lese-majeste law, it punishes whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent with imprisonment of three to fifteen years \\u2013 the same penalty as for involuntary manslaughter. \\n Hundreds of political activists including children have been prosecuted with the law since 2020. \\n \\u201cGIVE THAILAND A CHANCE\\u201d \\n The election on May 14 saw the highest voter turnout in Thailand\\u2019s political history. Data from the Election Commission showed about 39.3 million people came out to cast their votes, resulting in a voter turnout of 75.22 per cent. \\n There were about 52 million eligible voters in the polls, and more than 2 million of them had cast their ballots in advance voting on May 7. \\n Move Forward emerged as the winner with 151 seats in parliament, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 seats. The two parties then formed a coalition with six political allies, including Prachachat, Thai Liberal Party, Thai Sang Thai, Fair, Plung Sungkom Mai and Pue Thai Rumphlang. \\n With a total of 312 seats, the group commands a clear majority in the House of Representatives. \\n On Tuesday, Mr Pita said Thailand has \\u201cabnormal politics\\u201d created by the military-backed constitution, and that the vote on Thursday is an opportunity to make it normal again. \\n \\u201cGive Thailand a chance to have a rightful government that will progress to restore Thailand according to the people\\u2019s expectation. Give Thailand a chance to return to the path of parliamentary politics, in which the people can trust and place their hope,\\u201d he said in a video clip shared on his social media.\\u00a0 \\n \\u201cThe vote to select the prime minister that will take place on Jul 13 is not about choosing Pita or the Move Forward Party. It is about choosing to confirm that Thailand must move forward in a normal democratic system like other democratic countries around the world,\\u201d he added. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Related: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Commentary: Inequality fuelling the fire for Thailand\\u2019s political change \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thailand\'s monarchy looms over battle for prime minister post: Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    Source: CNA/pp(as)\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Related Topics\\n   \\n \\n      Thailand\\n   \\n \\n      Thailand election\\n   \\n \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Also worth reading\\n   \\n \\n Content is loading... \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Advertisement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Expand to read the full story\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      CNA Sections\\n   \\n \\n \\n Asia \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Singapore \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Business \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CNA Insider \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Lifestyle \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Luxury \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CNA938 Live \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Commentary \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Interactives \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Live TV \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Sport \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n World \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Special Reports \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      About CNA\\n   \\n \\n \\n About Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Advertise With Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Contact Us \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Hotel Partners \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Correspondents \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Presenters \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mediacorp Network \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      Pressed for time?

The context involves Pita Limjaroenrat, the leader of the Move Forward Party, who is vying to become the new Prime Minister of Thailand. But, there have been some legal challenges which could undermine his bid. Specifically, he's being scrutinized for holding 42,000 shares of a media firm ITV which he had during the May 14 election. Under the Thai Constitution, individuals are not allowed to run in an election as Members of the House of Representatives if they own shares in any newspaper or mass media business. Mr. Pita claims he was managing these shares on behalf of his family's inheritance fund and has since transferred them to other heirs. The situation has become complicated and is now under the review of the Constitutional Court. Please note that my capabilities as an AI, do not involve real-time updates or live analysis. Therefore, for the latest information on this issue, I recommend referring to the most recent news updates from reliable sources."

  "content": "GPT-3.5, which stands for \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5,\" is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is an advanced version of the GPT series, which aims to generate human-like text based on a given prompt.\n\nThe GPT-3.5 model utilizes a deep learning architecture called a transformer, which is particularly effective in handling sequential data like text. This architecture allows the model to understand and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n\nGPT-3.5 is trained on a vast amount of text data from the internet and can perform a variety of language tasks, including language translation, text completion, question-answering, and more. It has been trained on a diverse range of topics and can generate high-quality text that is often indistinguishable from human-generated text.\n\nThe model has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models ever created. This large parameter size gives GPT-3.5 a remarkable ability to understand and generate text across various domains and tasks.\n\nThrough the OpenAI API, developers can access GPT-3.5 to integrate its capabilities into their own applications, services, or products. This allows them to leverage the power of the language model in their own projects, providing more advanced natural language processing capabilities.\n\nOverall, GPT-3.5 represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing and opens up new possibilities for generating human-like text and improving language-related applications."

  "content": "Philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, and more. It seeks to understand the nature of reality and our place in it. Philosophers explore a wide range of topics, including ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, and aesthetics.\n\nEthics deals with moral principles and how we ought to live. Metaphysics considers the nature of reality and asks questions about the existence of God, the nature of the mind, and the relationship between mind and body. Epistemology examines the nature of knowledge and how we acquire it. Logic investigates the principles of valid reasoning. Aesthetics explores questions about beauty and art.\n\nPhilosophers use critical thinking, logical reasoning, and argumentation to analyze these topics. They engage in thoughtful contemplation and debate to deepen our understanding of the world and our place within it.\n\nThe study of philosophy can be traced back to ancient Greece, where philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundation for many philosophical ideas and concepts. Since then, philosophy has evolved and branched out into various schools of thought, including rationalism, empiricism, existentialism, and many others.\n\nPhilosophy is not just an abstract intellectual pursuit; it has practical applications in various fields such as law, politics, ethics, and science. It helps us critically evaluate our beliefs and assumptions, make informed decisions, and develop a well-rounded worldview.\n\nOverall, philosophy asks timeless questions and challenges us to think deeply and critically about the world, ourselves, and our place in it."

 Code-Text parser  is a custom  tree-sitter 's grammar parser for extract raw source code into class and function level. We support 10 common programming languages: 
 
 Python 
 Java 
 JavaScript 
 PHP 
 Ruby 
 Rust 
 C 
 C++ 
 C# 
 Go 
 
 Installation 
 codetext  package require python 3.7 or above and tree-sitter. Setup environment and install dependencies manually from source: 
 git   https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/CodeText-parser.git ;   cd   CodeText-parser
pip   install   -r   requirement.txt
pip   install   -e   .
 
 Or install via  pypi  package: 
 pip   install   codetext
 
 Getting started 
 codetext  CLI Usage 
 codetext   [ options ]   [ PATH   or   FILE ]   ...
 
 For example extract any python file in  src/  folder: 
 codetext   src/   --language   Python
 
 If you want to store extracted class and function, use flag  --json  and give a path to destination file: 
 codetext   src/   --language   Python   --output_file   ./python_report.json   --json
 
 Options 
 positional   arguments:
    paths                   list   of   the   filename/paths.

optional   arguments:
    -h,   --help              show   this   help   message   and   exit 
    --version               show   program ' s   version   number   and   exit 
    -l   LANGUAGE,   --language   LANGUAGE
                          Target   the   programming   languages   you   want   to   analyze.
    -o   OUTPUT_FILE,   --output_file   OUTPUT_FILE
                          Output   file   ( e.g   report.json ) .
    --json                  Generate   json   output   as   a   transform   of   the   default
                          output
    --verbose               Print   progress   bar

 Using  codetext  as Python module 
 Build your language 
 codetext  need tree-sitter language file (i.e  .so  file) to work properly. You can manually compile language ( see more ) or automatically build use our pre-defined function (the  <language>.so  will saved in a folder name  /tree-sitter/ ): 
 from   codetext.utils   import   build_language 

 language   =   'rust' 
 build_language ( language ) 

 # INFO:utils:Not found tree-sitter-rust, attempt clone from github 
 # Cloning into 'tree-sitter-rust'... 
 # remote: Enumerating objects: 2835, done. ... 
 # INFO:utils:Attempt to build Tree-sitter Language for rust and store in .../tree-sitter/rust.so 
 
 Using Language Parser 
 Each programming language we supported are correspond to a custome  language_parser . (e.g Python is  PythonParser() ).  language_parser  take input as raw source code and use breadth-first search to traveser through all syntax node. The class, method or stand-alone function will then be collected: 
 from   codetext.utils   import   parse_code 

 raw_code   =   """ 
     /** 
     * Sum of 2 number 
     * @param a int number 
     * @param b int number 
     */ 
     double sum2num(int a, int b) { 
         return a + b; 
     }  
 """ 

 # Auto parse code into tree-sitter.Tree 
 root   =   parse_code ( raw_code ,   'cpp' ) 
 root_node   =   root . root_node 
 
 Get all function nodes inside a specific node: 
 from   codetext.utils.parser   import   CppParser 

 function_list   =   CppParser . get_function_list ( root_node ) 
 print ( function_list ) 

 # [<Node type=function_definition, start_point=(6, 0), end_point=(8, 1)>] 
 
 Get function metadata (e.g. function's name, parameters, (optional) return type) 
 function   =   function_list [ 0 ] 

 metadata   =   CppParser . get_function_metadata ( function ,   raw_code ) 

 # {'identifier': 'sum2num', 'parameters': {'a': 'int', 'b': 'int'}, 'type': 'double'} 
 
 Get docstring (documentation) of a function 
 docstring   =   CppParser . get_docstring ( function ,   code_sample ) 

 # ['Sum of 2 number \n@param a int number \n@param b int number'] 
 
 We also provide 2 command for extract class object 
 class_list   =   CppParser . get_class_list ( root_node ) 
 # and 
 metadata   =   CppParser . get_metadata_list ( root_node ) 
 
 Limitations 
 codetext  heavly depends on tree-sitter syntax: 
 
 
 Since we use tree-sitter grammar to extract desire node like function, class, function's name (identifier) or class's argument list, etc.  codetext  is easily vulnerable by tree-sitter update patch or syntax change in future. 
 
 
 While we try our best to capture all possiblity, there are still plenty out there. We open for community to contribute into this project.

Setup environment and install dependencies manually from source: \\n git   https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/CodeText-parser.git ;   cd   CodeText-parser\\npip   install   -r   requirement.txt\\npip   install   -e   .\\n \\n Or install via  pypi  package: \\n pip   install   codetext\\n \\n Getting started \\n codetext  CLI Usage \\n codetext   [ options ]   [ PATH   or   FILE ]   ...\\n \\n For example extract any python file in  src/  folder: \\n codetext   src/   --language   Python\\n \\n If you want to store extracted class and function, use flag  --json  and give a path to destination file: \\n codetext   src/   --language   Python   --output_file   ./python_report.json   --json\\n \\n Options \\n positional   arguments:\\n    paths                   list   of   the   filename/paths.\\n\\noptional   arguments:\\n    -h,   --help              show   this   help   message   and   exit \\n    --version               show   program \' s   version   number   and   exit \\n    -l   LANGUAGE,   --language   LANGUAGE\\n                          Target   the   programming   languages   you   want   to   analyze.\\n    -o   OUTPUT_FILE,   --output_file   OUTPUT_FILE\\n                          Output   file   ( e.g   report.json ) .\\n    --json                  Generate   json   output   as   a   transform   of   the   default\\n                          output\\n    --verbose               Print   progress   bar\\n \\n Example \\n File circle_linkedlist.py analyzed:\\n==================================================\\nNumber of class    : 1\\nNumber of function : 2\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nClass summary:\\n+-----+---------+-------------+\\n|   # | Class   | Arguments   |\\n+=====+=========+=============+\\n|   0 | Node    |             |\\n+-----+---------+-------------+\\n\\nClass analyse: Node\\n+-----+---------------+-------------+--------+---------------+\\n| #   | Method name   | Paramters   | Type   | Return type   |\\n+=====+===============+=============+========+===============+\\n| 0   | __init__      | self        |        |               |\\n|     |               | data        |        |               |\\n+-----+---------------+-------------+--------+---------------+\\n\\nFunction analyse:\\n+-----+-----------------+-------------+--------+---------------+\\n| #   | Function name   | Paramters   | Type   | Return type   |\\n+=====+=================+=============+========+===============+\\n| 0   | push            | head_ref    |        | Node          |\\n|     |                 | data        | Any    | Node          |\\n| 1   | countNodes      | head        | Node   |               |\\n+-----+-----------------+-------------+--------+---------------+\\n \\n Using  codetext  as Python module \\n Build your language \\n codetext  need tree-sitter language file (i.e  .so  file) to work properly. You can manually compile language ( see more ) or automatically build use our pre-defined function (the  <language>.so  will saved in a folder name  /tree-sitter/ ): \\n from   codetext.utils   import   build_language \\n\\n language   =   \'rust\' \\n build_language ( language ) \\n\\n # INFO:utils:Not found tree-sitter-rust, attempt clone from github \\n # Cloning into \'tree-sitter-rust\'... \\n # remote: Enumerating objects: 2835, done. ... \\n # INFO:utils:Attempt to build Tree-sitter Language for rust and store in .../tree-sitter/rust.so \\n \\n Using Language Parser \\n Each programming language we supported are correspond to a custome  language_parser . (e.g Python is  PythonParser() ).  language_parser  take input as raw source code and use breadth-first search to traveser through all syntax node. The class, method or stand-alone function will then be collected: \\n from   codetext.utils   import   parse_code \\n\\n raw_code   =   \\"\\"\\" \\n     /** \\n     * Sum of 2 number \\n     * @param a int number \\n     * @param b int number \\n     */ \\n     double sum2num(int a, int b) { \\n         return a + b; \\n     }  \\n \\"\\"\\" \\n\\n # Auto parse code into tree-sitter.Tree \\n root   =   parse_code ( raw_code ,   \'cpp\' ) \\n root_node   =   root . root_node \\n \\n Get all function nodes inside a specific node: \\n from   codetext.utils.parser   import   CppParser \\n\\n function_list   =   CppParser . get_function_list ( root_node ) \\n print ( function_list ) \\n\\n # [<Node type=function_definition, start_point=(6, 0), end_point=(8, 1)>] \\n \\n Get function metadata (e.g. function\'s name, parameters, (optional) return type) \\n function   =   function_list [ 0 ] \\n\\n metadata   =   CppParser . get_function_metadata ( function ,   raw_code ) \\n\\n # {\'identifier\': \'sum2num\', \'parameters\': {\'a\': \'int\', \'b\': \'int\'}, \'type\': \'double\'} \\n \\n Get docstring (documentation) of a function \\n docstring   =   CppParser . get_docstring ( function ,   code_sample ) \\n\\n # [\'Sum of 2 number \\\\n@param a int number \\\\n@param b int number\'] \\n \\n We also provide 2 command for extract class object \\n class_list   =   CppParser . get_class_list ( root_node ) \\n # and \\n metadata   =   CppParser . get_metadata_list ( root_node ) \\n \\n Limitations \\n codetext  heavly depends on tree-sitter syntax: \\n \\n \\n Since we use tree-sitter grammar to extract desire node like function, class, function\'s name (identifier) or class\'s argument list, etc.  codetext  is easily vulnerable by tree-sitter update patch or syntax change in future. \\n \\n \\n While we try our best to capture all possiblity, there are still plenty out there.
